## How it works

4-bit counter which counts upwards on every clock cycle, as long as IN0 (Enable) is high. If Enable is pulled low the counter keeps its current value.
The counter counts from 0 to 9 and then automatically restarts at 0. The counter can also be reset by the high active reset.
The 4 bit counter value is output at the outputs OUT0-OUT3.
